## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**softsheng/softsheng** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

### ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
I'm currently engaged in developing an enterprise-level SMS messaging platform. It's designed to handle high volumes of SMS traffic for businesses, including one-to-one and bulk messaging. The platform manages message organization, categorization, and retrieval, and generates analytics and reports for evaluating messaging strategies. I'm focused on implementing strong security measures like encryption for sensitive data. To ensure a modular and maintainable codebase, I'm using the Model - View - Controller (MVC) design pattern. The goal is to build a reliable and efficient SMS platform that meets enterprise communication needs.

### ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
I'm currently learning about the latest Java frameworks like Spring Boot 3.0 and its new features such as native compilation to improve application performance and reduce startup times. I'm also exploring reactive programming in Java using libraries like Project Reactor. Additionally, I'm studying advanced database concepts like sharding and replication in NoSQL databases such as MongoDB to handle large - scale data storage more effectively.

### ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
I'm looking to collaborate on open - source Java projects that aim to improve the performance and scalability of web applications. I'm also interested in projects related to microservices architecture in Java, where we can work together to design and implement efficient communication between services and handle distributed system challenges such as service discovery and fault tolerance.

### ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
I'm looking for help with optimizing the performance of a multi - threaded Java application. I'm facing issues with thread - safety and deadlocks when dealing with shared resources. I'm also trying to understand how to better utilize the Java Memory Model to reduce memory - related bottlenecks and improve the overall efficiency of my code.

### ğŸ’¬ Ask me about
Ask me about object - oriented programming principles in Java, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. I can also provide insights into Java collections framework, including how to choose the right data structure (e.g., ArrayList vs. LinkedList) for different use - cases. Additionally, I'm well - versed in Java web development using Servlets and JSP, so feel free to ask me about building web applications from the ground up.

### ğŸ“« How to reach me:
You can reach me via email at [your_email_address]. I'm also quite active on GitHub (username: [your_github_username]) and Stack Overflow (username: [your_stack_overflow_username]), so you can connect with me or ask questions on those platforms.

### ğŸ˜„ Pronouns:
My pronouns are he/him.

### âš¡ Fun fact:
A fun fact about me is that I once built a Java - based chat application from scratch during a weekend just for fun. I used JavaFX for the user interface and sockets for network communication. It was a great learning experience and showed me the power of Java in building real - time applications.
